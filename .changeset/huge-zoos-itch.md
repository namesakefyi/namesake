Namesake is a free and open source app which simplifies legal name changes and gender marker changes in the US.

- Step-by-step name change "quests" let you track your progress across different tasks, from the initial court order to your Social Security, state ID or driver's license, passport, and more.
- Answers to frequently asked questions are included based on our experience helping to facilitate name change clinics in Massachusetts.
- Guided forms help you fill out all relevant paperwork, clarifying legal jargon.
- Recommendations are provided to open-ended form questions like "why are you changing your name?" to provide context about what the court is looking for, and suggestions about how to respond.
- Costs are clearly presented, and links to financial support are provided.
- All form responses are end-to-end encrypted, preventing anyone (even Namesake) from viewing your answers.
- We currently support name changes in Massachusetts, with plans to support more states over the following months.

Happy Pride!
