# Contributor Manual

## Getting Started

Namesake uses pnpm for package management. You may need to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) globally if you don't have it installed.

### Set up your local repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/namesakefyi/namesake.git
cd namesake
```

Within the `namesake` directory, install packages:

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Connect to Convex (first time only)

The first time you set up the app, you will need to connect to Convex. Run:

```shell
npx convex dev
```

Select "choose an existing project" and affirm "configure project namesake".

Convex will generate an `.env.local` file which points to a dev database for you to use.

### Start the dev server

To start developing locally, run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

> [!NOTE]
> The `dev` command will spin up the convex backend and the app's frontend in parallel. To run them individually, run `pnpm dev:frontend` or `pnpm dev:backend`.

## Dependencies

It's worth getting familiar with the Namesake app's core dependencies:
