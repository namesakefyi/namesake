# Forms

This directory contains all the blank PDFs that Namesake uses to fill forms.

## Naming and Organization

Forms should be titled using all lowercase `kebab-case`. File names should begin with the form code, if one exists, followed by the full form title. For example, the form "Petition to Change Name of Adult" with the code "CJP 34" has the file name `cjp34-petition-to-change-name-of-adult.pdf`.

If the form code contains any spaces or hyphens, those should be omitted. For example, the form code "CJ-D 400" is `cjd400`. Together with the title "Probate and Family Court Motion", the file name is `cjd400-probate-and-family-court-motion.pdf`.

State-specific PDFs should be placed within a folder using the state's two-character abbreviation, like `/ma`. Federal forms, such as ones for Social Security or Passports, go in `/federal`.
