# Forms

This directory contains all the blank PDFs that Namesake uses to fill forms.

## Naming and Organization

Forms should be titled using `kebab-case` and starting with the form code, if one exists. For example, the form "Petition to Change Name of Adult" with the code "CJP 34" would be titled `cjp34-petition-to-change-name-of-adult.pdf`.

If the form code contains any spaces or hyphens, those should be omitted. For example, the form code "CJ-D 400" is `cjd-400`.

State-specific PDFs should be placed within a folder using the state's two-character abbreviation. The above form would go within `forms/ma/cjp34-petition-to-change-name-of-adult.pdf`
