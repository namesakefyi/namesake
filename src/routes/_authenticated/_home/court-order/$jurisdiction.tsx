            The court petition is a formal request to the state to legally
            change your name. You’ll file this by mail or directly with a clerk
            at the Probate and Family Court in your county. If approved, you’ll
            be mailed a certified Decree of Change of Name, which is the
            official and legal proof of your name.

          <Step title="Review and print documents">
            Make sure everything looks accurate and complete any missing fields.
            Hold off on signing the Court Petition until you’re in the presence
            of a notary. To file your name change, you’ll also need a certified
            copy of your birth certificate, and legal records of any previous
            name changes.

          <Step title="Gather funds">
            Massachusetts charges a $150 filing fee + $15 surcharge fee + $15
            citation fee = $180 total filing fee. You can waive court fees if
            you meet the eligibility requirements in Massachusetts.

          <Step title="File documents">
            You’ll file this by mail or directly with a clerk at the Probate and
            Family Court in your county. We suggest filing in person, if you
            can.

          <Step title="Await decision">
            Typically, decisions take 2-6 weeks to arrive by mail.
